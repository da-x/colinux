Running Cooperative Linux
=================================================================

Cooperative Linux runs as headless daemon on the host operating 
system. However, a controlling console which emulates a VGA console
can be attached to it.

The colinux-daemon looks for a default configuration file in the 
current directory. The default name of this configuration file is 
default.colinux.xml, and it uses the XML format.

The default.colinux.xml file contains information about attached
block devices, boot time parameters, other devices, and where to
find the vmlinux file.

A standard Cooperative Linux installation directory contains the 
colinux-daemon executable, the cooperative Linux hostfs driver 
(linux.o or linux.sys, depending on the ooperating system), the
'vmlinux' file (see ./doc/building on host to build this file), 
and the colinux-console exectuable for controlling a running
coLinux instance. It may also contain images of block devices
that contain root filesystems.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<colinux>
    <block_device index="0" path="\DosDevices\c:\colinux\root_fs" enabled="true">
    <block_device index="1" path="\DosDevices\c:\colinux\swap_device" enabled="true">
    </block_device>
    <bootparams>root=/dev/cobd0</bootparams>
    <image path="vmlinux"></image>
</colinux>

This is an example of a coLinux XML configuration file. As you can
see, it uses two block devices, one as a root filesystem and another
as a swap device. Note the above configuration file is for a coLinux
that runs under Windows, and that these pathnames of these files are 
absolute under the convention of pathnames used by the Windows kernel.
