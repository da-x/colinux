=================================================================

1. Prerequisites
----------------

When compiling coLinux to run on Linux of the same architecture, 
only one compiler needs to be used.

For cross compiling, the components that comprise coLinux need to be
compiled using 2 differently targeted versions of GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org/).
One gcc is required for the native Linux architecture that coLinux is
designed to run on (i686-pc-linux), and the other version is used to
compile binary executables and drivers for the host OS (i686-pc-mingw32).

Please note that the newest version of gcc uses --target=i686-pc-linux-gnu
and not --target=i686-pc-linux . You could run ./config.guess to find the
correct name for --host but it is not correct to specify --host since it
should be guessed correctly (by ./config.guess script). You should not
specify --target if it is the same as --host when using the newest gcc.
So never use --host or --target unless you must (EG: when cross-compiling
or making a canadian-cross (when --host, --build and --target are !=)).

The versions of the two compilers need to match as closely as possible.
Versions 2.95.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x and 3.3.x of gcc are not guaranteed to
be ABI-compatible.

If the compiler used for building the kernel and the daemons doesn't have
the same version, you can't run coLinux. The daemon blocks this.

To resolve these problems, you should always build the Linux cross-compiler
(i686-pc-linux-gnu) and the Win32 compiler (i686-pc-mingw32) from the same
set of Gnu gcc sources and put it first in the search PATH. You can set the
variable 'COLINUX_GCC_GUEST*' in bin/*.cfg. The scripts build automaticaly
and use the specified compiler. This feature can be enabled using the option
--gcc-guest-build in "./configure".


2. Build systems
----------------

The coLinux source tree contains different types of build systems. The
simplest is a "./configure && make". This should be used if you are a new
coLinux devoloper and want to build coLinux binaries from source for the
first time.

The ./configure script is not the same as in other software projects. This
script does not detect all the needed tools and host environments. It creates
a simple configuration to make it easy to have "standard" Linux projects using
"./configure && make". This should help newcommers to compile coLinux.

Later you can run some of the scripts in bin directory by hand. For example,
you want only to rebuild the kernel, then run "cd bin; ./build-kernel.sh".
All scripts in the bin dir use settings from the main "./configure" script.

The usual situation is to rebuild the kernel without building the complete
coLinux (daemons). You do not need a cross platform for this step, so we
describe it, in this guide, in the step "Build non standard Linux kernel",
"4.2 Compiling the Cooperative Linux kernel (the vmlinux file)".

The texts are sometimes not up to date. You should know something about
building the kernel, patching and in general, using the gcc toolchain.

The source tree uses a Python build system to manage out-of-date sources
and allow for building different targets (WinNT and Linux) without using
"make clean". The Python build system starts with "make colinux" in the src
directory and needs various environment settings to be setup beforehand.

We suggest you start with "configure && make". When you are more familiar
with how coLinux is built you can try to use the shell scripts from the bin
directory.


3. configure && make && make installer
--------------------------------------

3.1 configure

Call './configure' in the toplevel directory to create the file
bin/user-build.cfg using the absolute paths of your installation.

Default target is WinNT. There are some options that can be used to override
the default directories. Run './configure --help' for a list of options.

Example for WinNT as host (default):
  ./configure --target=i686-pc-mingw32 \
        --downloaddir=$HOME/colinux-devel/download \
        --prefix=$HOME/colinux-devel/mingw32

For Linux as host you must use the option '--target=i686-pc-linux'. Host
kernel directories will be detected automaticaly. You can alter them by
using --hostkerneldir.

Example for Linux as host:
  ./configure --target=i686-pc-linux \
        --downloaddir=$HOME/colinux-devel/download \
        --targetkerneldir=$HOME/colinux-devel/download/linux-2.x.y
        --hostkerneldir=/usr/src/linux


3.2 make download

'make download' is optional. It downloads all missing source files.


3.3 make

Call 'make' in toplevel directory (not in src/) to build all cross tools, cross
compiler, libraries and target. Makefile is only a wrapper for bin/build-*.sh
scripts. Settings in bin/user-build.cfg are used by Makefile and a lot of other
shell- and Python- scripts.

Missing source files will be downloaded with wget.

To detect 'out of date' files this Makefile does not timestamps. Subversion
checkout (or download) can not handle timestamps. So we use md5sum to check
out new sources, patches or configuration. After every compile it updates the
md5sum file at the end.

Run "make help" to see what "make all" will build, if you do not give a target.


3.4 make package

'make package' will copy executables as ZIP file on dist directory.


3.5 make installer

'make installer' builds the complete coLinux installer.
This needs wine, "makensis" and more win32 installer tools.


3.6 make clean

This will only cleans the source tree of coLinux daemons.
The cross tools and libraries are untouched.


3.7 make distclean

This will also remove control files for md5sum, user-build.cfg and libraries.
But it will never remove your cross compiler (we hope, you have not installed
it under the coLinux source tree). After this step you must run './configure'
again.


3.8 Comments about configure system

This version of configure is provided only with the targets i686-pc-mingw32
or i686-pc-linux. No other strings supported. (Sorry, configure is very
simple.)

Some build steps are supported by a separate call. For example to compile
coLinux daemons without building the  kernel: 'make colinux'.  Optional
targets can be listed with 'make help'


4. Building a coLinux kernel
----------------------------

4.1 Kernel build dependencies

You can check the gcc version that was used to build your coLinux by typing
"dmesg | head -n1", this would print text like: "gcc version 3.4.5".  In
that case you need a gcc version 3.4.x, check it by running "gcc --version".
If you do not have it try "apt-get install gcc" to install it. If you do not
have such packet to install, probably you need to build gcc yourself from
source. The script bin/build-cross.sh does it, if you have ran "./configure".

The default gcc version is defined in the file bin/build-common.sh. You can
only change it, if there exists a MinGW version of this gcc. After changing
it, you also need to rebuild the cross gcc and all daemons. We suggest you
not change the gcc version to an older version. Read the coLinux changelog
(inside Subversion) about the problems with older gcc versions and the
fixes. If you are up to it then compile gcc-4.2.0 for MinGW and Linux.

Since coLinux version 0.7.2 the gcc dosn't longer depends on one major gcc
version. The ABI is runtime checked and inside the building now. This opens
more gcc versiond for kernel builds (tested from 3.4.x up to gcc 4.3.0).
Usebility of installed gcc can check with "./configure --no-create".


4.2 Compiling the Cooperative Linux kernel (the vmlinux file)

Unpack the source tarball of coLinux. Locate the file series-2.6.17
in the directory patch/. This file give you the supported kernel versions.
(version 2.6.17 for instance, can be obtained from www.kernel.org)
Unpack the kernel tar in home directory. Make sure that the directory 
of the Linux kernel is named 'linux-2.6.17'.

Apply the patches found in the series file to the Linux kernel
as exactly in this order.  If conflicts arrise, then it is
possible that there is a mismatch between the version of the kernel 
and the version that the patch is designed to apply to.

Series file was handled by quilt. You can create a single patch file
of all the pathes, than  you can use this summary file for patching
the kernel source.  Simply cat all files to one file.

Locate function "patch_kernel_source" from bin/build-kernel.sh, to find
more examples for patching kernel and the quilt handling.

For example:
    ~/# cd PathToColinux/patch
    ~/PathToColinux/patch# cat `cat series-2.6.17` > /tmp/sumary.patch
    ~/PathToColinux/patch# cd
    ~/# wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/2.6/linux-2.6.17.tar.bz2
    ~/# bunzip2 -dc linux-2.6.17.tar.bz2 | tar x
    ~/# cd linux-2.6.17
    ~/linux-2.6.17# patch -p1 < /tmp/sumary.patch
    ~/linux-2.6.17# rm /tmp/sumary.patch

The coLinux package is supplied with a premaid Linux kernel
configuration file. Copy it to your kernel tree:

    ~/linux-2.6.17# cp PathToColinux/conf/linux-2.6.17-config .config

Append coLinux version information to kernel version name:
    ~/linux-2.6.17# echo "-co-0.8.0" > localversion-cooperative

Update config and build vmlinux:
    ~/linux-2.6.17# make oldconfig
    ~/linux-2.6.17# make vmlinux

Module build and install:
    ~/linux-2.6.17# make modules
    ~/linux-2.6.17# su -c "make modules_install"


4.3 Testing new kernel builds

Then test to run this unchanged kernel with your daemons.

Be sure to save all your work and the disk cache, before you run your
new kernel. On windows, only a reboot save the disk cache. I suggest
you reboot windows _before_ you start the new kernel!

After these steps you can modify kernel config or add some special patches
and rebuild your special kernel.


4.4 Private kernel config

After the default kernel is working, you can call "make menuconfig" to change
your options.

If you have X11 try "make xconfig" or "make gconfig". You need to have
installed (on coLinux) the packages gtk+-2.0 glib-2.0 libglade-2.0 for xconfig
and install qt-mt for gconfig. It is a bit of work but it looks good!

Typing "make menuconfig" runs: "scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/i386/Kconfig"
Typing "make gconfig"    runs: "scripts/kconfig/gconf arch/i386/Kconfig"
Typing "make xconfig"    runs: "scripts/kconfig/qconf arch/i386/Kconfig"

The program "mconf" is a curses graphics interface both gconf and qconf use
X11. The qconf program saves it's setting (both X11 settings, EG: window size
and position and qcon settings, EG: wide of the individual panes and "show
options") but (as least for me, and I think I set it up correct) the gconf
program does NOT save these settings.

The gconf program seems to have a few more buttons to push than the qconf
program does and both (sometimes) show features differently than mconf. This
might be due to a bug in reading .config or simply my lack of familiarity
but I like to use mconf first (for it's simple run through of everthing)
and then go back and re-check with gconf to get a graphical presentation
of the choices I made and fix any of (my) mistakes.

It is very easy with either gconf or qconf to click from one section of
settings to another to check (or change) options that interfere (or need)
another option to work properly (or change what extra choices you have).
It is more difficult with mconf to cursor-key back and forth between the
options and get things set properly - so make (and use) both types :( .

When I built gconf it seemed unable to alter _some_ features (that were
NOT disabled) but did work to alter other features. Maybe something is
not working with the linux-2.6.17 kernel's version of gconf. With gconf
when I changed the setting for "show all options" the screen did not
update immediately, I needed to click a "screen-layout-button" and then
go back to the prior layout to refresh the screen. This does NOT happen
with qconf, it updates the screen immediately. I suspect qconf is working
better than gconf (but it _might_ be the way it was installed - I used
the standard method to install, so it is not my fault).


WARNING: Don't enable device drivers with direct hardware access (ISA-, PCI-
or VL-Bus) and don't change cpu specific configs. This will likely crash your
system.

Now run "make vmlinux modules" in the kernel source again and test it.

Save the file ".config" as your new default config in coLinux source tree
as conf/linux-2.6.17-config.


4.5 Add private kernel patches

Start from a clean build of kernel and test it, before you change any
kernel source.

Patching in your additional patch, use option --dry-run for testing.  After
your additional patch is clean or only some minor are wrong, you can run
patch without --dry-run.

Watch for *.rej files.  If they exist, add the non patched lines by hand to
the listend files.  Than create a fixed diff from the *.orig file.  Replace
wrong parts in your additional patch with the fixed diff parts.

Edit the series file in patch directory and add your new patch file at the
end.  Better way is, to use "quilt import" for your patch files.

Run the "make oldconfig", answer for the new devices with the right option.
If you are unshure, use 'N'.  Save the file ".config" as your new default
config in coLinux source conf/linux-2.6.17-config.

Run "make vmlinux modules" and check the new nernel.


5. Compiling the OS support code
--------------------------------

Compiling the operating system dependent support code is a little more
complex. The current build system assumes a cross compiler toolchain is 
installed for that purpose. 

This is the second way to compile coLinux, it's more flexible.  But you
need to setup all the paths and tools by hand.  These steps are for
devolopers with more background.


5.1. OS build Dependencies

Cross platform
  * MinGW (version 3.x)

The coLinux console depends on:
  * FLTK (major version 1)

Python build system
  * Python interpreter 2.3 or grater


5.2 For Microsoft Windows as host

5.2.1 Complete downloading and build for Win32 under Linux (MinGW32)

To compile source for a Windows target, the compiler must be self compiled
for this target. You can not download a binary of this compiler!

This needs a Compiler, devel-libraries and a lot of tools:
(Versions from my installation. Others works also, ./configure checks it.)
    bison-1.75		need by binutils (yacc 91.7.30 have error YYEMPTY)
    flex-2.5.4		need by binutils (arlex.l: Permission denied)
    gnu/gcc 3.4.5	for building guest kernel
    binutils 2.16.91	for building guest kernel
    make-3.80
    module-init-tools-0.9.14
    patch-2.5.9
    python2.3		for coLinux build system, need version 2.3+
    texinfo-4.5		need by binutils
    unzip-5.50.0	extracting winapi source
    wget-1.8.2		download source files
    zip-2.3		packing pre releases
    glibc-devel
    ncurses-devel
    ... and many more devel packets ...

Create a new directory, extract coLinux source in this directory, set
scripts executable and ran the download script in "bin" directory.

    mkdir $HOME/colinux-devel
    cd $HOME/colinux-devel
    tar xzf colinux-20061210.tar.gz
    cd colinux-20061210/bin
    chmod +x *.sh
    ./build-all.sh --download-only
    
Files will be downloaded into directory $HOME/colinux-devel/download.


5.2.2 Running the compiling script

Edit bin/user-build.cfg and set some directories.
It's unsafe to use a relative path in this build script. The BINDIR is mostly
the bin directory, but not in all cases!

build-all.sh --download-only	Download all missing files, step is optional
build-all.sh			Extract (OVERWRITE!) and compile all files
    build-cross.sh		Extract and compile the cross compiler
    build-colinux-libs.sh	Extract and compile all libs
    build-kernel.sh		Extract, patch, compile the kernel and modules
    build-colinux.sh		Recompile only the coLinux daemons and console

! Any starts of build-kernel.sh will delete all source and extract it again !
! If you have changed some kernel sources, set COLINUX_KERNEL_UNTAR="no" in !
! the file bin/user-build.cfg do save your work.  Or call "make menuconfig" !
! and "make vmlinux" into kernel directory manually                         !

build-all.sh is a complete build process for binutils, cross compiler,
libraries, kernel and colinux daemons. (~40 Minutes on 1.8MHz Pentium)

The build process based on build-all works completly at top-level
directory colinux-devel. The cross-compiler was also installed in users
directory (not system wide). We never need root rights for installing
headers, libs or programs.


After Downloading a new version of coLinux source, should only extract source
at same top level directory and run the last scripts build-kernel.sh and
build-colinux.sh. In some cases you might also need to compile the libs.
The cross compiler mostly never need compile again.

The work of build-all is controlled by md5sum of some sources and some
target files. Md5sum is updated after build step was complete and stored as
.build-*.md5 in 'BUILD' directory.  An "error on MD5" is not a file error
here, it's only a detection for outdated sources, where need to rebuild.

Call as 'build-all.sh --rebuild' will ignore md5sum and builds all
cross tools, cross compiler, libraries and target files again.

Single script can also use to recompile one step. For instance you can rebuild
the win32k-api and fltk library by calling 'cd bin ; ./build-colinux-libs.sh'


5.2.3 Create a pre-distributable package as ZIP

Run the common script to create a zip archives in directory 'dist' with all
executables for Windows host:

    . ./build-common.sh ; build_package

The target files should copy into a Windows host system, unpack the zip
files and installing or update the coLinux driver with these commands:

  cd OldColinuxPath
  colinux-daemon.exe --remove-driver
  cd NewColinuxPath
  colinux-daemon.exe --install-driver

5.3. For Linux as host

For building and runnning coLinux on Linux you need:

1. Tree or headers of the designated host kernel available, in order to build 
   the kernel module (colinux.ko).
   Currently works only with host kernel 2.6.x,
   tested up to 2.6.8.1, 2.6.10 - 2.6.18.
   2.6.19 as host kernel is not usable.
   Host kernel should not set CONFIG_REGPARM, coLinux can't run there.
   >=2.6.20: "-mregparm=3" in arch/i386/Makefile is badly idea for coLinux.
2. patched fltk-1.1.6 (see patch directory) installed in the 
   system (./configure ; make ; su -c "make install")
   You can also install this version under your HOME (see below).
3. Properly set the environment variables (e.g.):

  export COLINUX_TARGET_KERNEL_PATH=/path/to/your/patched/colinux/kernel/tree
  export COLINUX_HOST_KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/your/host/kernel
  export COLINUX_HOST_OS=linux
  
And run make in the 'src' dir.

Running it is quite simple. For example, consider these list of files:

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  566805 Jun 21 13:02 colinux-console-fltk
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  289478 Jun 21 09:58 colinux-daemon
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  107509 Jun 21 09:58 colinux-net-daemon
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  115637 Jun 21 13:02 colinux-serial-daemon
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  341519 Jun 21 13:02 colinux.ko
-rw-r--r--  1 root root     399 Jun  5 18:17 colinux.cfg
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 2614823 Jun 21 13:02 vmlinux

The steps are basically:

    xhost +
    su
    insmod colinux.ko
    PATH=.:$PATH colinux-daemon @colinux.cfg

This much like the Windows port except where the logic around the installation 
of the driver is more simple.

You should run coLinux in a graphic environment, KDE, Gnome or after 'startx'.
'xhost +' allows root (su) to use your user desktop (access control disabled).

PATH=.:$PATH is needed, if the executables aren't installed in your e.g 
/usr/local/bin or elsewhere in $PATH.


5.3.1 For Linux as host with different libraries (patched FLTK)

- Patch and build fltk from source

  cd /tmp
  tar xjf fltk-1.1.6-source.tar.bz2
  cd fltk-1.1.6
  patch -p1 < colinux-source/patch/fltk-1.1.6-linux-patch.diff
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-linux-local
  make -C src
  make -C src install
  make -C FL install
  cd /tmp
  rm -r fltk-1.1.6

- Run coLinux configure with path to this fltk

  cd colinux-source
  export PATH=$HOME/i686-linux-local/bin:$PATH
  ./configure --target=i686-pc-linux ...

- Run coLinux build with path to FLTK libraries

  export COLINUX_TARGET_KERNEL_PATH=/path/to/your/patched/colinux/kernel/tree
  export COLINUX_HOST_KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/your/host/kernel
  export COLINUX_HOST_OS=linux
  export COLINUX_CFLAGS="-I$HOME/i686-pc-linux-local/include"
  export COLINUX_LFLAGS="-L$HOME/i686-pc-linux-local/lib"
  make HOSTOS=linux colinux


6. Create, resize and optimize images
-------------------------------------

Mostly images are created from minimal distribution installation under Qemu.
From Qemu-image should use the option "offset" for loop mount.

Tips for cleanup the image:
- Run "apt-get clean" on Debian to remove all downloaded files.
- Remove files
	/lib/modules/*-co-*
	/boot
	/var/log/*.gz
	/var/run/*.pid
- Clean files in /var/log (don't remove files! Set the size to zero.)

Final clean and resize the image:
- You should have an image file, named "image.old" here
- Create an new empty file.  This is the best to compress it very small.
  Use your favorite size as count. Blocksize is 1MB, the count=1024 in
  the example creates a file with size of 1GB. Increase the count for
  bigger images.

	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/image.new bs=1M count=1024

  For coLinux version >= 0.7.1 the old and new image files can live on "cofs"
  mounted file system.  That means, you can create the new image directly in
  your Windows filesystem (... of=/mmt/cofs-Windows/image.new ...).

- Create a filesystem on the new file

	mkfs.ext3 /tmp/image.new

- Mount new and old images

	mkdir /tmp/new
	mount -o loop /tmp/image.new /tmp/new
	mkdir /tmp/old
	mount -o loop,ro /tmp/image.old /tmp/old

- Copy all files from old current image into the new image.

	cd /tmp/old
	cp -ax * /tmp/new/
	cd /tmp

- Unmount images

	umount /tmp/new
	umount /tmp/old

- Check and cleanup file system

	fsck.ext3 -f /tmp/image.new

- Disable time based "Check interval", set more mount counts

	tune2fs -i 0 -c 60 /tmp/image.new

  CoLinux version 0.6.4 counts +2 per boot with initrd, the default 30/2
  would be very often check the file system on boot.

- Compress this image

	bzip2 </tmp/image.new >/tmp/image.bz2

- Test the /tmp/image.new on coLinux now.
  If it fails, repair it and repeat the steps from beginning
