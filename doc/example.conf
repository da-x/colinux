# This is an example for a configuration file that can
# be passed to colinux-daemon in this manner:
#
#    colinux-daemon @example.conf
#
# Note that you can still prepend or append configuration and 
# boot parameters before and after '@', or you can use more 
# that one '@ to load several settings one after another.
# 
#    colinux-daemon @example.conf @overrider.conf mem=32

# The default kernel
kernel=vmlinux

# File contains the root file system.
# Download and extract preconfigured file from SF "Images for 2.6".
cobd0=c:\coLinux\root_fs

# Swap device, should be an empty file with 128..512MB.
#cobd1=c:\coLinux\swap_device

# Tell kernel the name of root device (mostly /dev/cobd0,
# /dev/cobd/0 on Gentoo)
# This parameter will be forward to Linux kernel.
root=/dev/cobd0

# Initrd installs modules into the root file system.
# Need only on first boot.
initrd=initrd.gz

# Maximal memory for linux guest
#mem=64

# Networking (tuntap as private network between gust and host)
#eth0=tuntap

# Slirp for internet connection (outgoing) on second linux adapter.
# Inside running coLinux configure eth1 with this static settings:
# ipaddress 10.0.2.15   broadcast  10.0.2.255   netmask 255.255.255.0
# gateway   10.0.2.2    nameserver 10.0.2.3
#eth1=slirp

# Setup for serial device
