The Cooperative Linux Daemon hosts the Linux virtual machine as one process 
under the host operating system. Its command line syntax is as follows:

  colinux-daemon [-h] [-d] [-t name]
                  ([-c config.xml]|[configuration and boot parameters])

    -h             Show this help text
    -c config.xml  Specify configuration file
                   (default: colinux.default.xml)
    -d             Don't launch and attach a coLinux console on
                   startup
    -t name        When spawning a console, this is the type of 
                   console (e.g, nt, fltk, etc...)

    Configuration and boot parameters:

      When specifying kernel=vmlinux (where vmlinux is the kernel image file
      the -c option is not needed. Instead, you pass all configuration via
      the command line, for example:

       colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux cobd0=root_fs root=/dev/cobd0 hda1=:cobd0

    Use of new aliases automatically allocates cobd(s), for example:

       colinux-daemon mem=32 kernel=vmlinux hda1=root_fs root=/dev/hda1

    Unhandled paramters are forwarded to the kernel's boot parameters string.

The daemon spits out the kernel's printk() messages along with its own prints. It
also optionally launches the virtual VGA console, that can be used to interface
with the virtual machine.

The following options are specific to Windows NT/XP/2000:

      --install-service [name]     Install colinux-daemon.exe as an NT service
                                   (default service name: Cooperative Linux)
      --remove-service [name]      Remove colinux service
                                   (default service name: Cooperative Linux)
      --install-driver             Install the colinux-driver (linux.sys)
      --remove-driver              Install the colinux-driver (linux.sys)
      --status-driver              Show status about the installed/running driver

It is also possible (and sometimes preferable) to configure coLinux from the 
command line, i.e, XML config is not needed. This mode and the XML mode are 
mutual exclusive.

The reason for this feature is an ongoing effort to bring coLinux's
interfaces to be closer to UML (User Mode Linux) *and* to make it  
easier to operate for the novice users.

The kernel= option enables this mode. Order of parameters is not
important when options don't depend on each other.              

 For example:

     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux

   Boots a kernel without any block devices.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux mem=32

   Boots the kernel with 32 MB of RAM.


     colinux-daemon -d kernel=vmlinux mem=32

   The '-d' option still works.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux cobd0=c:\coLinux\root_fs

   It automatically adds \DosDevices\ where needed. Make sure
   you use double-slashes in the situations where shell escaping
   forces you to.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux cobd0=c:\coLinux\root_fs root=/dev/cobd0 ro

   Of course we need to pass root= to the kernel. Note that every
   parameter in that command line that is not handled by coLinux's
   code is passed along as a kernel boot parameters.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux cobd0=root_fs root=/dev/cobd0

   ... and resolve relative pathnames.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux cobd0=root_fs hda2=:cobd0 root=/dev/cobd0

   Device node aliasing. The ':' tells the daemon that's cobd0
   is not a pathname - understand using the next example.


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux hda1=root_fs root=/dev/hda1

   This makes life a lot easier. If you map an device node
   directly - it would automatically allocate a cobd and
   make an alias for it!

   This syntax reminds a bit of QEMU's syntax (it also has
   hda=).


     colinux-daemon kernel=vmlinux hda1=root_fs root=/dev/hda1 initrd=initrd.gz

   Upgrade your kernel modules for this snapshot.


 Options for networking:

     eth0=tuntap

   Use the first TAP device.


     eth0=tuntap,"Local Area Network"

   You name it.


     eth0=tuntap,"Local Area Network",11:22:33:44:55:66

   Set a MAC address.


     eth0=pcap-bridge,"Local Area Network"

   Uses PCAP bridging.


     eth0=slirp,,tcp:2222:22/tcp:8080:80

   Uses SLiRP networking, with port 2222 and 8080 on host being
   redirected (or port forwarded) to coLinux guest 22 and 80.

   Redirections must begin with protocol ("tcp" or "udp") then
   an ":" seperator, the port on coLinux guest followed by ":"
   seperator, and the port for the host.  More redirections
   have the same form and are seperated by "/".

 Options for console device:

   FLTK console is configurable via environment settings.


     set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=Lucida Console:12

   Sets fontname and size.  Allows only fixed width fonts.


     set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=Lucida Console

   Sets fontname.


     set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=:12

   Sets only size. Default font "Terminal" is active.
