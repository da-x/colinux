colinux-daemon - help/manpage
=============================

The Cooperative Linux Daemon hosts the Linux virtual machine as one process
under the host operating system.

The daemon splits out the kernel's printk() messages along with its own prints.
It also optionally launches the virtual VGA console, that can be used to
interface with the virtual machine.  For every network device it launches a
network daemon.


Command Line Parameters for installing/removing
-----------------------------------------------

The following options are specific to Windows NT/XP/2000.

    --install-service servicename startparameters

	Allows you to install Cooperative Linux as a service.

	<servicename> is whatever you want it to be called.
	<startparameters> is the list of colinux start options (see follows)
	or the config file with options as '@configfile'.

	To run the service you should use the windows service managment
	console or the command line tool "net start".

	Example:
	colinux-daemon @example.conf --install-service "coLinux"
	net start "coLinux"

    --remove-service servicename

	Allows you to remove the Cooperative Linux service.
	Please shut down coLinux, before removing the service.

	Example:
	net stop "coLinux"
	colinux-daemon --remove-service "coLinux"

    --install-driver

	This command installs the driver portion of Cooperative
	Linux. NOTE: This already happens during the installation
	of coLinux, in most cases you don't need to run it at all.

	If the driver is already installed, this command would
	reinstall the driver.

	This command is not compatible with any other parameters.

    --remove-driver

	This command will remove the driver portion of Cooperative
	Linux. BIG NOTE: This already happens during the uninstall
	of coLinux, in most cases you don't need to run it at all.

	Please shut down coLinux, before removing the driver.
	This command is not compatible with any other parameters.

	You can also remove the linux.sys driver with standard Windows tools
	and many mouse clicks.  Open your System settings - control panel -
	hardware device	manager - under "View" options enable "view hidden
	drivers" - open the non PnP drivers - locate and uninstall the device
	entry "CoLinuxDriver" and reboot Windows.

    --status-driver

	Show status about the installed/running driver.
	This command is not compatible with any other parameters.


Command Line Parameters for running
-----------------------------------

The following command line paramaters may be useful in operating Cooperative
Linux for running from command line.

    @configfile

	Allows you to choose a specific configuration file to
	use, can have multiple @configfile on the command-line,
	last on the command-line take precedence and overrides
	earlier @configfile options

    -k

	suppresses Kernel messages (good for debugging other daemons)

    -t consoletype

	Allows you to specify either the FLTK (default) or NT (-t nt)
	console to use on startup.

    -d

	Don't launch and attach a coLinux console on startup.  This is
	the default for running as service.

    -p pidfile

	Write PID to file.
	It is mostly for running more as one coLinux instances on one machine.
	Console can read the pid from this file.

    -v level

	Verbose messages, level 1 prints booting details, 2 or
	more checks configs, 3 prints errors, default is 0 (off)

    -h

	Shows a short help text


Configuration and boot parameters
---------------------------------

The following parameters can be written into the configfile or,
if the first command-line argument on the command line is
kernel= you will be able to give all the configuration on the
command-line.  Order of parameters is not important when options
don't depend on each other.  The parameters are case sensitive.

    kernel=<path to vmlinux file>

	This specifies the path to the vmlinux file.

	Example:
	kernel=vmlinux

    initrd=<path to initrd file>

	This specifies the path to the initrd file.

	The file initrd.gz from coLinux installation upgrades your
	kernel modules for this snapshot.  After first run of a new
	coLinux version, you can remove this parameter from your config.

	Example:
	initrd=initrd.gz

    mem=<mem size>

	This specifies the memory size, assumes MB is the the
	unit type, so 64 is same as 64MB. Default if you leave
	this parameter out is 1/4 of your RAM if your RAM is >=
	128, otherwise it's 16.  Default value is generally ok.

    cocon=<COLS>,<ROWS>

	This specifies the console size. Default is 80x25.
	Minmum is 16x2,	maximum is near 200x80 (total 16384 cells).

	Example:
	cocon=120x40

    cobdX=<path to image file>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify the block device image file.

	<path to image file> is typicali a filname of your image file,
	for example the base root fs, you have extracted.

	It automatically adds \DosDevices\ where needed.  Make sure you use
	double-slashes in the situations where command shell escaping forces
	you to (the @configfile needs no escaping).

	If verbose output is anabled, coLinux prints more about the configured
	and canonized device paths. In this case a "\DosDevice\C:\..." would
	normal see as "\??\C:\..." - windows internal name.

	<path to image file> can be also a partition using standard
	\Device\HarddiskX\PartitionY format.  Harddisk starts by 0,
	Partition starts by 1.  Be carefully with these accesses,
	mount it read only at the first time and check the contains.
	Don't mount a partition, where Windows is using in same time!
	Partitions should only use non beginners to make a "dualboot"
	runable.

	Examples:
	cobd0=rootfs.img
	cobd1=C:\temp\swapfs.img
	cobd2=\Device\Cdrom0

    scsiX=<type>,<path to image file>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify the block device image file.
	
	<type> is 'disk' or 'cdrom'.

	<path to image file> is typicaly a filname of your image file,
	for example the base root fs, you have extracted.  This can be an
	image of disk (/dev/hda), instead the partition self (dev/hda1).
	Linux kernel scans for partition tables, fdisk is usable.
	
	<path to image file> can be a raw disk drive, with format
	"\\.\PhysicalDriveX", where X starts with 0 for first harddisk.	Be
	carefully with these configs, you risk datas on your drive C:.
	Don't mount a partition that is in use on windows side!

	For scsi0 the the device inside coLinux is /dev/sda, if type is cdrom
	or the image file is a part of partition self (all current images).
	If file has partition tables, the devices /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, ...
	are usable.

	Examples:
	scsi0=disk,file.img
	scsi1=cdrom,file.iso

    alias=<path to image file> | :cobdX

	This makes life a lot easier. If you map an device node
	directly - it would automatically allocate a cobd and
	make an alias for it!

	This syntax is similar to QEMU's syntax (it also has hda=).

	<alias> is any of the linux typicaly harddisks (hda1, sda1, etc).
	<path to image file> is the same as above.

	Example:
	hda1=rootfs.img		# (cobdX maps automaticly from first free)
	hdc=\Device\Cdrom0	# CDROM as raw device. Mount as iso9660.

	OR:  Device node aliasing.

	The ':' tells the daemon that cobdX is not a pathname.  After you
	have defined a "cobdX=..." priror, you can set an alias for this
	codbX - read the next examples for understanding more.

	Example:
	cobd0=rootfs.img	# /dev/cobd0 is now the image file.
	hda1=:cobd0		# /dev/hda1 and cobd0 are the same now.

    cofsX=<path to windows directory>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify a Cooperative Host filesystem
	device (mount Host directory to coLinux	local mount point).  There
	are some limitations with it, same as under Windows (':' colon and
	'\' Backslash in names).

	<path to windows directory> can be any of the directory of your
	Windows.  BIG NOTE: Be carefully with full drives (C:\), because
	coLinux has admin rights on this mount point.  Read-only-mount is
	a good idea.

	Examples:
	cofs0=C:\coLinux	# (Directory)
	cofs1=R:\		# (CDROM drive, USB drive etc.).

	More about using cofs and mount options you will find in file cofs.txt
	in your installation.

    ethX=slirp | tuntap | pcap-bridge | ndis-bridge ,<options>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify network interfaces.
	The first argument select the interface type on host side,
	follow by any more options.

	Consult README.TXT about installation and use of network types,
	and the page 'Network' in Wiki with lots of example combinations.

	For all network interfaces can configure a <MAC>, if you wish a
	constant hardware identification number.  Set six hex numers starts
	with 02:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx as locally administered address.  Use different
	numbers for every interfaces in your network environment.  Every MAC
	should exist only ones per time in your network.  If <MAC> is not set,
	colinux	builds a random number on every start.  This can be irritate
	routers, dhcp cache tables and some udev based distributions.  It's
	better to setting the MAC here.

    ethX=slirp,<MAC>,<redirections>

	Slirp, the simplest way to internet. It needs no changes or installs
	on the Windows side.  Slirp sends and receives only TCP and UDP packets
	to the current active adapater over the Windows API (WinSock).  You can
	not send and not receice IMCP messages, this means ping and traceroute
	dont't work.  To check your network you must use some other commands,
	for example wget, ftp, etc.

	Slirp works as "outgoing only" firewall from coLinux virtual machine
	to the world.  In typicaly mode can not connect from outside to the
	colinux guest.  Incommings can enable with the <redirections>.

	BIG HINT: In firewalls on your Windows host should allow the outgoing
	connections for the programm colinux-slirp-net-daemon.exe.

	Use any number <X> of these to specify network interfaces.
	<MAC> and <redirections> are optional.

	Set a <MAC>, if you wish a constant hardware identification number.

	<redirections> take the form tcp|upd:hostport:linuxport[:count],
	multiple redirections are seperated by /, ie tcp:2222:22/tcp:8080:80
	<Redirections> must begin with protocol ("tcp" or "udp") then an
	":" seperator, the port on Windows host, followed by ":" seperator,
	and the port for the coLinux guest.  Optional third ":" seperator
	counts for port array.  More redirections have the same form and
	are seperated by "/".

	Examples:
	eth0=slirp			# Simplest slirp mode (outgoing only)
	eth0=slirp,,tcp:22:22		# Forwards SSH from host to guest
	eth0=slirp,,tcp:2222:22		# Forwards 2222 on host to guest 22
	eth0=slirp,,tcp:2222:22/tcp:4000:80:3	# Forwards counts of ports
						# Host --> guest (coLinux)
						# 2222 --> 22
						# 4000 --> 80
						# 4001 --> 81
						# 4002 --> 82
	eth0=slirp,02:00:00:00:00:01	# Configure MAC address

	Inside coLinux use a DHCP-Client to get the parameters, or set static
	parameters (hard coded, no others please):

	# ifconfig eth0 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.2.255
	# route add default gw 10.0.2.2
	# echo "nameserver 10.0.2.3" > /etc/resolv.conf

    ethX=tuntap,<network connection name>,<MAC>

	Tuntap is a private network between the coLinux and host only.  This
	is the fastest network connection between Windows host and coLinux
	virtual machine.  The network should be configured with a subnet area
	that is not used on your Windows host on other adapters.  You can
	route the tuntap to outside on the real network, but this is more
	complicated and needs a network specialist for Windows and Linux.
	Beginners should use tunetap only in the typicaly way as SSH login
	or VNC network connection between windows host and coLinux guest.

	Use any number <X> of these to specify network interfaces.
	<network connection name> and <MAC> are optional.

	<network connection name> is the name of TAP adapter, installed on
	your host system, mostly named "Local Connection 1".  Without name
	coLinux use the first TAP adapter.  Let the name empty, if you have
	only one TAP driver installed.  Other TAP devices (from VPN) does
	no interference here. If have more as one TAP (coLinux) driver
	installed, then *must* set the name. Good idea is to rename the	network
	connection inside windows networking overview into more readable
	name, for example "TAP-coLinux".

	Set a <MAC>, if you wish a constant hardware identification number.

	Examples:
	eth0=tuntap				# Use the first TAP device.
	eth0=tuntap,"Local Area Network"	# You name it.
	eth0=tuntap,,02:00:00:00:00:02		# Set a MAC address.

    ethX=pcap-bridge,<network connection name>,<MAC>,<promisc>

	Pcap-Bridge use an ethernet library to send and receice various
	ethernet frames over your real network adapter card.  It's agents as
	an additional network card on the one real exist card.  This allows
	you, to connect coLinux virtual machine to the world.  In seeing from
	outside your Windows host has an additional network card with a second
	MAC, differ from your real card.  From coLinux machine you can do all
	what you wand with an ethernet card (Ping, DHCP from router, TCP/IP,
	IPX and many more protocols).  You must know: This type adds a virtual
	network card in your network, and this not works in some IT security
	policy.  Some wireless cards don't work with pcap-bridge, while the
	MAC is differ on the same one connection channel.
	Pcap-bridge does not work without a real netwoking connection.  This
	means, you can not use this network type, if your real network adapter
	is not connected (unplugged).

	Use any number <X> of these to specify network interfaces.
	<network connection name> must be a name of your real ethernet or
	wireless card.  Use Quotation marks for spaces in name.  It is typical
	"Local Connection". The name is optional, if have only pcap-bridge
	interface (and no tuntap). If you have tuntap or more as one network
	cards in your windows then please set the name here.

	<MAC> and <promisc> are optional.

	Set a <MAC>, if you wish a constant hardware identification number.

	Default is 'promisc', Promiscuous mode allow to receive packets
	that not directly adressed to that adapter (sniffing mode).  This
	works for cable Ethernet adapters.  Some cases (Wireless cards) works
	only with 'nopromisc'.

	For this type of networking must install the Windows Packet Capture
	Library "WinPcap.dll" from  http://www.winpcap.org/install/

	Examples:
	eth0=pcap-bridge,"Local Area Network"	# Uses PCAP bridging.
	eth0=pcap-bridge,"Local Area Network",02:00:00:00:00:03,nopromisc
						# Define a MAC address and
						# disable the Promiscuous mode.

    ethX=ndis-bridge,<network connection name>,<MAC>,<promisc>

	Ndis-Bridge use kernel ndis library to send and receice various
	ethernet frames over your real network adapter card.  It's agents as
	an additional network card on the one real exist card.  This allows
	you, to connect coLinux virtual machine to the world.  In seeing from
	outside your Windows host has an additional network card with a second
	MAC, differ from your real card.  From coLinux machine you can do all
	what you wand with an ethernet card (Ping, DHCP from router, TCP/IP,
	IPX and many more protocols).  You must know: This type adds a virtual
	network card in your network, and this not works in some IT security
	policy.  Some wireless cards don't work with pcap-bridge, while the
	MAC is differ on the same one connection channel.
	Ndis-bridge does not work without a real netwoking connection.  This
	means, you can not use this network type, if your real network adapter
	is not connected (unplugged).

	Use any number <X> of these to specify network interfaces.
	<network connection name> must be a name of your real ethernet or
	wireless card.  Use Quotation marks for spaces in name.  It is typical
	"Local Connection".

	<MAC> and <promisc> are optional.

	Set a <MAC>, if you wish a constant hardware identification number.

	Default is 'promisc', Promiscuous mode allow to receive packets
	that not directly adressed to that adapter (sniffing mode).  This
	works for cable Ethernet adapters.  Some cases (Wireless cards) works
	only with 'nopromisc'.

	The difference between pcap-bridge is, that ndis-bridge works in a
	kernel mode, no needs to install pcap library and is faster.

	Examples:
	eth0=ndis-bridge,"Local Area Network"	# Uses NDIS bridging.
	eth0=ndis-bridge,"Local Area Network",02:00:00:00:00:04,nopromisc
						# Define a MAC address and
						# disable the Promiscuous mode.

    ttysX=<serial device name>,<mode parameters>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify serial interface (ttys0),
	and host specific device name (COM1).  <mode parameter> sets
	baudrate, data format and line disciplin.  Refer your host system
	help (MODE -?) for more options.

	Serial device supports only transmit and receice bytes.  Controls
	(mode settings) are not supported from virtual machine side.  Inside
	coLinux can only run with one baudrate and mode from startup setting.

	Examples:
	ttys0=COM1	# Connects the serial device /dev/ttyS0 from linux
			# to host system COM1.  Please set the line
			# parameters for serial port on hostsystem,
			# before colinux starts.

	ttys0=COM1,"BAUD=115200 PARITY=n DATA=8 STOP=1 dtr=on rts=on"
			# Sets many more default parameters for the serial
			# port.  Please refer you manual or help system of
			# host system for optional parameters ("MODE /?").

    execX=<executable program>,<parameters>

	Use any number <X> of these to specify order of launching a
	program and terminamte at stopping linux.  Use Quotation
	marks, if more as one parameter.

	Example:
	exec0=C:\Programs\Xming\Xming.exe,":0 -clipboard -multiwindow -ac"
			# Program Xming.exe runs at start of colnux and
			# terminate it, if colinux is shutting down.

    root=<root device>

	This is the device (as coLinux gues sees it) to the root
	device.

	Of course we need to pass root= to the kernel.

	Example:
	root=/dev/cobd0

    ANY additional parameters are passed to the coLinux kernel as is
    (unmodified) kernel boot parameters.
    For example "init 5" runs linux on specific runlevel.

    See the file "example.conf" in your colinux installation directory for
    full example.


Environment settings
--------------------

    COLINUX_NO_SMP_WORKAROUND=Y

	Currently there's a bug on SMP that prevents coLinux from running
	stable unless it is pinned to the first processor.

	With 'COLINUX_NO_SMP_WORKAROUND=Y' coLinux runs on all processors.

    COLINUX_CONSOLE_EXIT_ON_DETACH=1

	If this set, then colinux FLTK/NT console will be close after
	shutting down and detach coLinux.
	This is good option for closing console after linux shutting down.

    COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=<Windows Font Name>:<Size>

	Set the font type and size for FLTK console.  Only fixed fonts
	are allowed.

	Example:
	set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=Lucida Console:12

	Change font size only.  Default font "Terminal" is still active:
	set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=:12

    COLINUX=<Install path>

	Installer sets the path to your coLinux installation in environment
	for all users.


Used keys in Windows Registry
-----------------------------

# Automatic generated MAC, monitor number 'M', network device index 'X'
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\coLinux\monitor\M\ethX]

Special keys in consoles
------------------------

    FLTK console:

	Win+V			inserts text from copy & past buffer

    NT console:

	Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del	sends Ctrl+Alt+Del to Linux

	Win+LeftAlt		detach from colinux
