colinux-debug-daemon.exe
------------------------

This is a configurator and debug logger.  You need to start it before you
wish to see more internals from coLinux system. Start it after colinux
driver is installed (normal case after the Installer was done, or after
you runs colinux-daemon --install-driver) and before launch your Linux
via colinux-daemon.


Command Line Parameters
-----------------------

    -d
	Download debug information on the fly from driver.
	Without -d, uses standard input.

    -p

	Parse the debug information and output an XML

    -f filename

	File to append the output, instead of writing to standard output.
	Write to file with flush on every line.

    -s level=num,level2=num2,...

	Change the levels of the given debug facilities.
	A highter value give more outputs, 0 disable the facility.

    -n ipaddress

	Send logs as UDP packets to ipaddress:63000
	(requires -d)

    -e exitcode

	Translate exitcode into human readable format.

    -h

	Shows a short help text


Short guide to see more error messages
--------------------------------------

Open a windows command prompt, change into coLinux install directory and
run the debug-logger:

	C:
	cd \coLinux
	colinux-debug-daemon.exe -d -p -s prints=31,misc=31 -f debug.xml

Than start colinux (as console application or as service).
Whenever you means that the trace point was done, stop debug logger
with key CTRL-C on the colinux-debug-daemon.

Open the file debug.xml with Internet Explorer or notepad and view
near the end of file.  Search the text, you was seen from colinux-daemon
and view near this linies in the debug.xml.  Mostly the debug says more
about your problem as the colinux-daemon console.



Stepguide for colinux-daebug-daemon
-----------------------------------

1) Open a Command Prompt or shell window and cd to the coLinux directory,
   e.g. "cd c:\colinux"

2) To see a list of options:

        colinux-debug-daemon -h

3) To see a list of "facility" names:

	colinux-debug-daemon -d
	(Type ^C to exit back to the cmd prompt.)

   * "facilities" are different types of messages that the daemon can
     capture. The current list of facility names is:
     misc, network, messages, prints, blockdev, allocations, context_switch, pipe
   * Each facility has an associated level number - higher numbers
     capture more messages.  Facility can be turn off with value 0.
   * See below for how to set the facility level


4) To capture and display some messages:

	colinux-debug-daemon  -d  -p  -f mylogfile.xml  -s network=11,blockdev=9

   * "-d" makes it get the raw debug messages in real time from a
     running colinux session.  Without "-d", it gets the raw debug
     messages from standard input, presumably from a previously-captured file.
   * "-p" makes it decode (parse) the raw debug messages and display
     them in human-readable form (encapsulated in XML markup).  Without
     "-p", I presume that it just sends the raw debug messages to the
     output, perhaps so you can capture them to a file in a compact
     form for later inspection.
   * "-f mylogfile.xml" makes it append the output to the file
     "mylogfile.xml".  Without "-f", it sends the output to standard
     output.  As far as I can tell, "-f filename" is equivalent to
     ">>filename", but it flushes more file caches.
   * "-s network=11,blockdev=9" sets the "network" facility level to
     11, thus capturing network messages sent at levels 0-11, and the
     "blockdev" facility level to 9.
   * To determine the desired facility level, either increase the
     number (trial and error) until you see the level of detail you
     need, or inspect the source code for the component you wish to
     debug to see the level at which the desired messages are sent.

5) There is also a "-n  ip-address" switch that will send the raw logs
   to UDP port 63000 at the indicated IP address, instead of to standard
   output or a file.

6) There is a python program to listen on port 63000 and write the logs
   to a file.  The python program is in the source tarball, in
   src/colinux/user/debug/server.py

7) There is a python program to decode and display the XML-formatted (preparsed)
   messages.  It is in the source tarball, in src/colinux/user/debug/dump.py .
   It is not strictly necessary to use this program; the XML-formatted messages
   are in ASCII and are easy enough to read directly.

8) The source code for colinux-debug-daemon is in the source tarball, in
   src/colinux/user/debug/main.c

9) The source code for various other colinux helper daemons (i.e. the things that
   ultimately send the debug messages) is in the source tarball in various places.
   For example, the bridged network daemon source for Windows is in
   src/colinux/os/winnt/user/conet-bridged-daemon/

10) Debug messages are sent by calls like the following:

	co_debug_lvl(network, 13, "packet sent (0x%x written)\n", write_size);

Example debuging over network
-----------------------------

You can run coLinx on one PC (TARGET) and send all debugging messages over
network to an other PC (DEVEL).  This is very helpfull, if your colinux
crashes your PC and you can not log into local filesystem.

Run small Python script inside coLinux sources, to download all raw
debugging datas into file:

    DEVEL: python src/colinux/user/debug/server.py debug.bin

Or run Netcat (Linux) as debug server:

    DEVEL: netcat -l -u -p 63000 > debug.bin

On the other PC open command prompt, run debug logger with network
option '-n' and the ipaddress to your 'server' PC:

    TARGET: colinux-debug-daemon.exe -d -s prints=31,misc=31 -n ip.of.devel.pc

Open a second command prompt and run colinux:

    TARGET: colinux-daemon.exe @colinux.conf
    
Can also run the debug-daemon after coLinux was started. The debug session
should start, before you think is interesting.
After finish your debug session stop colinux-debug-daemon with CTRL-C and
stop the server.py (or netcat) with CTRL-C.

Convert the binary data into readable XML format:

    DEVEL: colinux-debug-daemon -p < debug.bin > debug.xml

Now can convert the XML file into a text file with one line per log entry:

    DEVEL: python src/colinux/user/debug/dump.py debug.xml > debug.txt

Typicaly output for debug.txt are such lines:

    DEVEL: cat debug.txt

    1|00000000.496810439|colinux-daemon|src/colinux/os/winnt/user/misc.c:co_terminal_printv:37|prints "Cooperative Linux Daemon, 0.8.0"

Howto see debug prints from kernel driver
-----------------------------------------

Run regedit, create a registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\coLinux",
create a new DWORD with Name "Debug" and set the value to 1F (hex).
Or create such file colinux-debug.reg and import it:

	Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\coLinux]
	"Debug"=dword:0000001f

Download DbgView.exe from http://www.sysinternals.com
( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx ),
run the DbgView.exe,
relaod the coLinux driver with:

    cd CurentColinuxPath
    colinux-daemon.exe --remove-driver
    colinux-daemon.exe --install-driver

Start coLinux with "colinux-daemon @YourConfig"
Watch the output from DbgView, typicaly will see such lines:

    [m:colinux-driver f:0 l:10 src/colinux/kernel/manager.c:49:co_manager_load] loaded to host kernel
    [m:colinux-driver f:0 l:10 src/colinux/kernel/manager.c:63:co_manager_load] machine has 480 MB of RAM
    [m:colinux-driver f:0 l:10 src/colinux/kernel/manager.c:37:set_hostmem_usage_limit] machine RAM use limit: 416 MB

Every line has the follow format:

    m: module
    f: facility (0=misc)
    l: level
    following by filename, linenumber, function name and the text.

The registry key will only read on driver loading, typicaly on booting Windows.
Debug outputs decreases coLinux running speed. Remember to remove the registry
key Debug, or set it to "0" for normal running mode.


Howto use Windows crash dump
----------------------------

Enable minidump (the small option, 64KB). Not need a full core dump.
Don't set the ckeckbox for "automatic reboot after crash dump". The menu
will find via keys Windows+Pause (or Control Panel * System Properties) *
Register: Extentions * Frame: Start and Recover * Button: Configure *
Frame: System errors.

If you think, coLinux would crash on start or with your next doing, then
should restart Windows after your last changes on configuration and before
you starts coLinux. This saves your last doing and write back all file
buffers to disk.

Typicaly BSOD have such lines:

   *** STOP: 0x1111777A (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   ***    linux.sys - Adress F799992F0 base at F7989000, DateStamp 46c6e118

0x1111777A in this case is an call of BugCheck, because coLinux detects an
internal error. There exists some more with similar error code 0x11117777
to 0x1111777F. Grep into coLinux source and locate the "0x11117777 + n",
where 'n' is the number '3' in the example.

F7989000 and F799992F0 in this case needs to know to find any address from
windows crash in the dumped linux.sys later.

Note all the hex numbers exactly down to paper and restart Windows. In
Event Manager finds mostly the hex numbers later, but not in all cases.

Download from "Install Debugging Tools for Windows 32-bit Version"
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/installx86.mspx
the Current Release of "Download the Debugging Tools for Windows"
http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/debuggers/dbg_x86_6.7.05.1.exe
approx. 15MB.

Windows will say, that no symbols was found. That is no problem. Windows
will never seen the GCC symbols. XP Symbol names we not need. You can
download and install they from "Download Windows Symbol Packages"
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/symbolpkg.mspx
approx. 200MB. But worth downloading and installing IMHO. Install they,
if you wish to see more Windows names (see example follow).

Symbols can online use. This loads symbols only for used files and stores
it on local cache (typicaly 4MB). For example, to download symbols to
c:\websymbols, you would add the following to your symbol path:
SRV*c:\websymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
Read more on http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/debugstart.mspx

Please don't change or replace the file "linux.sys" from there you got the
crash before the next step!

Run WinDbg.exe, and "Open Crash-Dump ...". The file typicaly exists as
C:\WINDOWS\Minidump\Mini081807-01.dmp (file name is coded by current date).

In the prompt "kd>" run

  !analyze -v

and than "Write windows text to file ..." (in the menu "edit").

CoLinux developers interest for the follow lines:

    BugCheck 1111777A, {f79b02f0, 8b606015, 0, 0}
    ...
    Probably caused by : linux.sys ( linux+9a48 )
    ...
    STACK_TEXT:
    (... please all lines ...)

This lets see the Stack, for example:
  STACK_TEXT:

If you have installed the Windows symbols and set the path, then all the
labels with "nt+..." would see with the windows names, for example:

Is a liddle bit better to read. But names from linux.sys can't see.


Howto see label names from minidump - script way
------------------------------------------------

Locate the file bin/mindump-repaint-labels.sh inside coLinux source.
Unpack linux.sys from archive daemons-*.dbg.zip from same build date
as the BSOD was triggered. If you have self build coLinux, then use the
file from src/colinux/os/winnt/build/linux.sys.
"minidump.txt" in the example is the saved output from "!analyze -v".
Run the script with paths to your files:

    mindump-repaint-labels.sh linux.sys < minidump.txt > backtrace.txt

View into file backtrace.txt, the caller stack should be more readable now:

  f7a54b04 f79a9a48 1111777a f79b02f0 8b606015 nt!KeBugCheck+0x14
  f7a54b34 f79a8a07 00000000 f79b02f0 8b606015 linux!co_os_malloc+0x28		(linux+0x9a48)
  f7a54b54 f79a609d 8147e000 00000001 814844cc linux!co_monitor_os_init+0x17	(linux+0x8a07)
  f7a54b84 f79a206a 8155bf60 814e2000 f7a54bb4 linux!co_monitor_create+0x18D	(linux+0x609d)
  f7a54bc4 f79a7189 8155bf60 00000011 814e2000 linux!co_manager_ioctl+0x2E8	(linux+0x206a)
  f7a54c34 804eddf9 8155bea8 81497ed0 806d02d0 linux!dispatch_wrapper+0x419	(linux+0x7189)
  f7a54c58 805749d1 8155bea8 81497ed0 814fbe78 nt!IofCallDriver+0x32
  f7a54d00 8056d33c 000007c4 00000000 00000000 nt!SeQueryAuthenticationIdToken+0x6c6

Please double check, that you use the right linux.sys from crash. Other case
the label names would give function calls, that never would find in source.


Howto convert label names from minidump - manualy way
-----------------------------------------------------

If the must convert by hands, you need the coLinux build environment under
Linux. Or objdump.exe from mingw32 to run directly under windows.
There start:

  i686-pc-mingw32-objdump -D linux.sys > linux.sys.dump

Open linux.sys.dump and view the first lines:

  linux.sys:     file format pei-i386
  Disassembly of section .text:
  00011000 <_co_monitor_get_pfn>:
   11000:       55                      push   %ebp
   11001:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp

You will see, that linux.sys starts with code 0x00011000. An other offset
is the 0x1000 in the linker params. So, the real offset from windows runtime
WinDbg to the dump is 0x10000.

For example "linux+0x9a48" is 0x19a48 in the dump.  Locate "19a48:" in
linux.sys.dump and view some lines before to get the function name.

The top of function give the start address. Sub the address 00019a20 from
stack address 18a48 to have the relative offset 0x28. The stack have now
decoded as "linux!co_os_malloc+0x28".

00019a20 <_co_os_malloc>:
   ...
   19a3d:       68 7a 77 11 11          push   $0x1111777a              <-- this pushed the parameter for KeBugCheck
   19a42:       ff 15 74 31 02 00       call   *0x23174                 <-- this is the call to KeBugCheck
   19a48:       83 c4 0c                add    $0xc,%esp                <-- this address is shown in stack as 'linux+0x9a48'

The next stack label is "linux+0x8a07". Add the 10000 to have 18a07 and
locate this in the linux.sys.dump file, pick the function name from some
lines before 18a07. Now have the next caller. Do the same steps for all.

000189f0 <_co_monitor_os_init>:
   ...
   18a02:       e8 19 10 00 00          call   19a20 <_co_os_malloc>
   18a07:       83 c4 10                add    $0x10,%esp

00015f10 <_co_monitor_create>:
   ...
   16098:       e8 53 29 00 00          call   189f0 <_co_monitor_os_init>
   1609d:       83 c4 10                add    $0x10,%esp

00011d80 <_co_manager_ioctl>:
   ...
   12065:       e8 a6 3e 00 00          call   15f10 <_co_monitor_create>
   1206a:       83 c4 10                add    $0x10,%esp

00016d70 <_dispatch_wrapper@8>:
   ...
   17184:       e8 f7 ab ff ff          call   11d80 <_co_manager_ioctl>
   17189:       83 c4 20                add    $0x20,%esp


Write down the coLinux names. The stack can better read now:

  f7a54b04 f79a9a48 1111777a f79b02f0 8b606015 nt!KeBugCheck+0x14
  f7a54b34 f79a8a07 00000000 f79b02f0 8b606015 linux+0x9a48		linux!co_os_malloc+0x28
  f7a54b54 f79a609d 8147e000 00000001 814844cc linux+0x8a07		linux!co_monitor_os_init+0x17
  f7a54b84 f79a206a 8155bf60 814e2000 f7a54bb4 linux+0x609d		linux!co_monitor_create+0x18d
  f7a54bc4 f79a7189 8155bf60 00000011 814e2000 linux+0x206a		linux!co_manager_ioctl+0x2e8
  f7a54c34 804eddf9 8155bea8 81497ed0 806d02d0 linux+0x7189		linux!dispatch_wrapper+0x419
  f7a54c58 805749d1 8155bea8 81497ed0 814fbe78 nt!IofCallDriver+0x32
  f7a54d00 8056d33c 000007c4 00000000 00000000 nt!SeQueryAuthenticationIdToken+0x6c6

The NT kernel calls are in the list of imports.
For example the "call *0x23174" can find in the dump as:

00023174 <__imp__KeBugCheckEx@20>:
   23174:       4c                      dec    %esp
   23175:       33 01                   xor    (%ecx),%eax

This example was written down by forcing BugCheck with a special hacked
source via a "co_os_alloc(0)". In the real run you would have other
addresses in the stack list.


Testing different versions
--------------------------

If you can't analyse the stack self, you can send it to coLinux developers.
Very interesting is the exactly build date of the file linux.sys. Please give
the name or date of snapshort you used. Good idea is to note the file size.
The stack can only properly view, if we use exactly the same linux.sys for
objdump, that created the BSOD.

If you are testing various coLinux versions, then should be shure, that you
have clean load the driver linux.sys with the colinux-daemon.exe from same
build. Check, that linux.sys and colinux-daemon.exe in your directory have
the same build date. A file "overwrite" of the file linux.sys is not enouth
to use this driver. To be shure, run:

    cd CurentColinuxPath
    colinux-daemon.exe --remove-driver
    colinux-daemon.exe --status-driver    <--- should say: Driver not installed
    cd NewColinuxPath
    colinux-daemon.exe --install-driver
    colinux-daemon.exe --status-driver

In some heavy cases needs to reboot Windows between remove and install.
