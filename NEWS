      --targetkernelsource and --targetkernelbuild as replacement for
      the obsolate --targetkerneldir for configure.
    - Allow to use ccache (http://ccache.samba.org/).
    - Use quilt for kernel patches, if quilt installed, fallback if not.
    - 'make package' creates one zip archive with and an other without
      debugging symbols.  The zip with symbols only will no more create.

        * bind 10.0.2.2 to Window's localhost, instead of window's LAN adapter
        * Packets from Windows host are translated to 10.0.2.2,
          other packets are routed but not translated
        * Slirp redirection now works without any real network adapter
        * Fix Slirp redirection to work on LAN if colinux started before LAN is

  * Synced several linux files for linux host builds to winnt files
    for winnt host builds.
  * build scripts now use POSIX shell syntax.
  * Max Memory upted to 1000MB & tested.

    variable (only allows fixed width fonts):
    set COLINUX_CONSOLE_FONT=Lucida Console:12
  * Added "sdo" to scsi aliasing.
  * Lots of other document, little bugs, etc...

* Version 0.6.2
  * The entire configuration can be passed on the command line instead
    of using an XML file (working towards UML compatibility). Read
    doc/colinux-daemon.
  * Linux patch ported to Linux 2.6.8. Linux 2.4.x will not be
    officially supported anymore. (Dan Aloni and George Boutwell).
    If you use an old root file image you might need to fix it,
    read about moving to 2.6.x in the Wiki site
    (http://www.colinux.org/wiki/)
  * Implemented a Cooperative file system driver in Linux, that
    makes it possible to mount host OS directories in Linux, similar
    to UML's hostfs. It lets you access your C:\ without using
    Samba or other network file systems. Read doc/cofs.
  * coLinux should now work under PAE setups and AMD64 setups that
    enable the NX bit (specifically, Windows XP SP2).
  * The slirp network daemon was added. This network daemon provides
    easy-to-set-up outbound network communication from coLinux
    without using the TAP driver or PCAP library.
  * initrd support was added (teesoft2004 at yahoo.com.cn).
    To activate it you can specify e.g. <initrd path="..." /> in the
    configuration, or initrd=filename in the command line.
  * Bug fix: Reception and delivery of network packets bigger than
    2kb.
  * Bug fix: Consoles and/or other daemons fail to connect to
    colinux-daemon on startup (this is Windows only).
  * Bug fix: Stop reboots where different gcc compiler versions are
    used to compile linux.sys & vmlinux, with an error/warning
    (George Boutwell).
  * Bug fix: Proper floating point state preservation in the Linux
    guest. coLinux now passes the flops20 test program.
  * Bug fix: A tiny memory leak when coLinux is shutting down.
  * Bug fix: Proper reference counting of the driver in the Linux
    port.
  * Bug fix: The network driver (conet) now verifies checksums (as
  * Changed PCAP handling to use Connection Name instead of
    Adapter/Device/Driver name. Name is now uniform between PCAP &
    TAP and multiple devices of the same/make/model should be able
    to be connected to. (George Boutwell)
  * Support AltGr for both FLTK & NT consoles. (Sascha Kettler)
  * Added a coserial deamon (only Linux for now), that allows one
    to open a serial terminal to the guest machine. (You can run
    /sbin/mgetty ttyS0, etc.)
  * Improved debugging - we now have a debug messages "collector"
    deamon named colinux-debug-deamon, which collects debug messages
    from all the coLinux components. This also changes the way things
    are printed when you run the daemon (it is now easier to see
    what belongs to what). All debug messages are off by default,
    so things may go a little faster.
  * An API version number was added to make sure that you use the
    right vmlinux and user-space executables with the right coLinux
    driver (previously it caused crashes if the APIs changed).
  * Added block device aliasing, e.g alias="hda2". You can specify
    such an alias in the <block_device> element in the configuration
    XML and expect coLinux to mount it, even when passed with root=.
    NOTE: The cobdX device and its alias are mutual exclusive, which
    means that you can't mount both of them at the same time. 
  * Implemented a new timer for the Linux guest, this should fix
    time-going-back issues.
  * Improved message passing, which may boost networking a bit.
  * Win32-TAP driver upgraded to version 8.1. This version doesn't
    bring any changes to the actual driver code. However it was
    released in order to notify the other projects that bundle the
    TAP driver along with their software, to modify the name
    identifer of the driver so that multiple TAP driver users can
    coexist (e.g, OpenVPN with coLinux). Therefore, coLinux now
    installs its TAP driver as TAPxxxxco (where xxxx is the
    driver version).
    After installing it, you will notice " (coLinux)" appended to
    the device name in the Network Connections manager. The old
    driver will remain until it is uninstalled.
  * If the MAC address is unspecified, a random MAC is choosed 
    using the familiar TAP prefix (00:FF:XX:XX:XX:XX).
  * Enhanced coLinux keyboard handling support (sends raw scan codes
    from Windows to linux) (Nuno Lucas).
  * Change memory allocation so that the RAM for the VM is not
    allocated on startup, but on-demand. This means the coLinux
    loads faster and less prune to memory allocation failures
    in the host.

* Version 0.6.1 
  * Multiple virtual NICs are supported (eth1, eth2, etc...).
  * Some small bugfixes.
  * Added the ability to send Ctrl-Alt-Del to the Linux machine.
  * Linux patch updated to 2.4.26
  * Linux port (for systems running kernel 2.6.x)
  * Fixed a crash that could happen on swapoff().
  * Initmem is freed (no more 'missing implementation')
  * The number of maximum cobd block devices was increased to 32.
  * The daemon process is pinned to the first processor until
    we get the SMP stability issue fixed.
  * Time is not going backward for gettimeofday() users anymore.
  * Support for running more than one instance of coLinux is now functional.
  * No port I/O allowed from userspace: the guest Linux can't change the host's
    clock, and it also fixed crashes that were caused by trying to run X.
  * Windows: 
    * Sizes of raw partition devices are now detected properly. This
      means that the resierfs problems should be over, plus cat /dev/cobd*
      would work for you.
    * Suspension of the host machine won't cause colinux-daemon problems like
      memory leaks.
    * The daemon can install itself as a service (Jaroslaw Kowalski).
      Stopping the service sends Ctrl-Alt-Del to let the Linux VM
      shutdown cleanly.
    * The daemon can install the linux.sys driver separately from its run,
      which can allow you to run coLinux as any user that have access to
      the installed driver (Daniel R. Slater).
    * coLinux now builds using MingW32 and no longer depends on cygwin1.dll.
    * Added scripts for building the MingW32 cross compiler on Linux,
      plus scripts that download, compile, and install the libraries
      coLinux depends on.
    * The name of the TAP device to use can be specified with the
      'name' attribute in the XML. NOTICE: The name is matched against
      the string that appears in Network Connections (e.g., 'Local Area
      Connection') and not the device name assigned by Windows (e.g.,
      'TAP-Win32 Adapter')
    * The driver is installed from the daemon's installation directory
      rather than from the current running directory.
  * Linux port:
    * Sending SIGHUP to the daemon causes it to issue Ctrl-Alt-Del on the
      Linux VM.
  * Consoles:
    * Fixed a bug in the clear operation: let it clear with the right video
      erase character so that ncurses apps would appear properly.
    * Fixed virtual console switching (alt-f1, alt-f2, etc.) so it will
      save/redraw the screen like it should.
    * FLTK: The cursor is visible again.
    * If keyboard focus is taken away from the consoles, it will release
      any pressed key in the VM.

* Version 0.6.0 AKA "Getting even"
  * Ballard, Jonathan H.:  
    * fixed implicit declarations
    * added co_os_realloc()
    * fixed overflow with the XML memory config
    * reimplemented os/winnt/user/daemon.c.
      A threaded implementation with with message queue,
      wait state, and error recovery.
    * merged the NT-native console.
    * console updates and improvements (cocon, console-nt)
    * update FLTK/console clearscreen (20040305)
    * enabled console-nt exit (20040305)
  * Added more checks to the XML parsing.
  * Made the context switch code more sensitive about the processor's
    capabilities, running coLinux on old AMD processors will hopefully not
    cause a reboot anymore.
  * Linux patch upgraded to 2.4.25.
  * Hopefully fixed the %fs/%gs issue for good.
  * vmlinux can now be bigger while not causing the host to boot, this means
    that you can compile more stuff not as modules.
  * Reimplemented the method in which coLinux allocates memory in the host
    kernel. It now allocates memory from the unmapped free page pool, which
    means you can use more than 256MB of RAM, unlike the previous method.
    Note that the first coLinux boot may be a little slower since Windows is
    freeing cache and swapping out stuff in order to provide accommodation for
    Linux's memory. You can see it in action by looking at the Task Manager.
  * NSIS-based installer for the Windows binary distribution (based on
    work by NEBOR Regis.
  * gettimeofday() now works. Things that broke because they depended on it
    should now work. I have to enable port I/O in order to for this to work,
    but I plan to disable it in the future. If you compile a new vmlinux
    Make sure that CONFIG_X86_TSC is enabled in your .config file.
  * New daemon switch -t: Type of console to launch. Default is fltk.
  * Added an NSIS installer script.

* Version 0.5.4 AKA "Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis" (%gs/%fs) release
  * Fixed an issue with i686-optimized pthread and the preservation of
    %gs and %fs. The crashes that were caused by the i686 Gentoo image
    should now disappear.
    WINE would also work now ;)
  * cobd: Fixed accessing large block devices (1GB >). cobd0 was passing
    wrong information to userspace.
  * conet: Statistics are now gathered (patch by Pat Erley)
  * Tuned the time conversion between Windows and Linux. The machine is 
    now initialized with the right date, not 4 days backwards.
  * Applied a configuration parsing fix (patch by Ballard Jonathan)
  * Some improvements of the switch code. We now preserve more registers,
    (MMX/SSE/SSE2/FP), and coLinux now has its own GDT. These changes 
    should assure stability on more systems and processors.
    This fix also appears to solve the problem where processes were stuck
    on nanosleep() calls.
  * conet-pcap: pcap-based daemon (contributed by Alejandro R. Sedeno).
  * Network configuration is now handled in the coLinux configuration XML.
    For backward compatibility, add:
    <network index="0" name="TAP" type="tap"></network>

    If you want to use pcap (i.e, bridged Ethernet), add:
    <network index="0" name="XXXX" type="bridged"></network>
    (Where XXXX is a substring of your network adapter's name)

    Optional attributes: mac="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" - specifies the MAC
    address of the interface in the Linux side. Recommended on bridged
    networking setups, where more than one Windows machine will be
    running coLinux on the same subnet.

    I also prepared the ground for supporting more than one network device
    (i.e, eth1, eth2, etc.), but it is not yet completed.
  * linux: avoid more I/O in time.c.

* Version 0.5.3 AKA "Valentine release"
  * Virtual CMOS system time is now passed to Linux, you no longer
    need to update the time using ntp on boot. Note that the virtual CMOS
    time is GMT, so the coLinux machine needs to set its own timezone.
  * cobd's devfs support was added to the Linux patch. Gentoo would work
    now (based on a patch from Pat Erley).
    A Gentoo root filesystem was created and released by Pat Erley.
  * Fixed an unwanted termination that was discovered when devfs was compiled
    in to the kernel.
  * Fixed an issue with mxml and the passage of boot parameters.
  * colinux-console: Fixed the CPU utilization issue.
  * colinux-console: Escape doesn't close the window now.
  * coLinux RAM is configurable, using a memory element in the XML under
    <colinux>, like: <memory size="64"></memory>. Minimum is 8MB, maximum
    is 192MB.
    WARNING: high values might destabilize Windows, because the memory is
    allocated from the non-cached pool which has a maximum of 256MB
    system-wide, meaning there's less left for Windows drivers and
    subsystems.
  * bin/cobuild.sh: Thomas Fritzsche contributed this script which
    automates the creation of a cross compilation cygwin environment
    on Linux.

* Version 0.5.3-pre2
  * Fixed the reported (and unreported) network bugs.
  * Worked out some scheduling issue.

* Version 0.5.3-pre1 AKA "flamed chicken"
  * Fixed a BSOD bug (thanks Richard Goodwin for the memory dump stacks)
  * No longer depending on the Microsoft DDK for the build (review doc/building),
    (thanks Nir Perry for the encourgement)
  * The daemon launches the console by default when it is launched (can be turned
    off with '-d', see '-h').
  * The daemon is killable just like a normal Windows process. Doing so stops the
    Linux machines cleanly (from Windows' standpoint), so feel free to close the
    window, end the task, CTRL-C, etc.
  * It no longer depends on the Microsoft DDK for the build.
  * An almost complete rewrite - we now use message passing instead of hardwired
    ioctls(). Only the daemon communicates with the driver. The console and the
    network daemon communicate with the daemon using a named pipe.
  * Fixed the block device bug that fsck triggered (thanks Daniel Glockner)
  * Hopefully addressed the network corruption issue (thanks Daniel Glockner again)
  * Boot parameters are now passed to the kernel. Make sure you update your
    XMLs with 'root=/dev/cobd0' if you still want to boot from the first
    block device.
  * The conet daemon is a separate process (shouldn't affect you).

* Version 0.5.2
  * Added some missing files to the build tree
  * doc/cygwin-cross-build - How to build a cygwin cross compilation tools
    on Linux.
  * Made the daemon more proofed to mistakes. It's logic about loading/
    unloading the driver is much more sane now.
  * Added a cursor support to the console.
