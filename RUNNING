Cooperative Linux $CO_VERSION README
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Instructions for running Cooperative Linux for Windows (see source for 
how to build and run coLinux for Linux)

WARNING: 

  Although Cooperative Linux may be actually useful on some setups
(e.g, stable setups), it is still meant for testing purposes only. 
This means that running it may crash the host (Windows or Linux system).

KNOWN ISSUES:

  Any known issues for an release can be found on the Wiki 
http://wiki.colinux.org

  PLEASE REPORT and read about problems on the colinux-devel@sourceforge.net 
mailing list or file an Bug report at 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/colinux

NOTES ON UPGRADING:

 1. XML config files have been removed.  Use the command-line 
    syntax in a name=value per line plain text file instead:

	kernel=vlinux
	initrd=initrd.gz
	mem=32
	cobd0=fs\root_fs
	cobd1=fs\swap_fs
	eth0=slirp
	root=/dev/cobd0
	ro

 2. Gentoo users need to be careful, Gentoo tends to use devfs when
    upgrading from 0.6.1 and so block device names change from cobdX to cobd/X
    and render the image unbootable.  For more details and solutions see the
    2.6 related information on the Wiki (http://wiki.colinux.org/)

 3. The file initrd contains no modules.  Modules are only in the file
    vmlinux-modules.tar.gz.  The initrd extracts modules over device cofs31
    automaticly, if you configure it as "initrd=initrd.gz" in config file.
    After modules are installed, you can remove the initrd from config.

RUNNING:

To run Cooperative Linux, please follow these instructions before trying to
run anything.

1. Run the downloaded installer file to begin the installation. 
   
2. Choose an installation directory. It is better to choose c:\coLinux because
   this way you don't need to edit the configuration XML since the pathnames
   of block devices files are currently aboslute. However, note that any 
   directory should be acceptable.

3. Choose networking method(s) to install. Currently there are three choices:

	a. Slirp - The simplest way to use networks in coLinux.  This runs as
	user application on the Windows host and needs no changes on the host
	networks.  Slirp is a good choice for dialup networks and WLAN cards.
	Slirp use all times the current outgoing interface and forwards (NAT)
	networking from linux to the internet world.  Slirp is a virtual
	Gateway for all outgoing TCP and UDP connections (no IMCP, no ping).
	Standard installation works as firewall to your linux.  It means, you
	can not connect from windows side to your linux.  To allow incomings
	from host system to linux, must additional configure 'redirections'.
	Slirp has a DHCP-Server for linux side.  To use slirp, edit your CFG
	file and set "slirp" as first parameter.  Inside linux use DHCP-Client
	to get your network configuration.  Read more about slirp in the Wiki
	page Network at http://wiki.colinux.org/

	b. TAP driver - This method installs a virtual network adapter that can 
	then be either shared or bridged with a physical network connection. 
	Note that this requires Internet Connection Sharing or Bridging 
	(Windows XP or higher) or a 3rd party Internet connection 
	sharing application. See the Wiki at http://wiki.colinux.org/ for
	more information/help. The TAP method autmatically chooses the TAP 
	first TAP adapter it finds, if you have multiple TAP WIN32 devices, you 
	can specify the specific adapter by name (for sample "TAP-Colinux").

  	c. Bridging - This method allows the Cooperative Linux network 
	interface to directly interoperate with one of your built in networking 
	interfaces. You'll need to edit the configuration file to reflect 
	that type "pcap-bridge" and the 'name' parameter needs to be set to a 
	substring of the network connection name that you will be bridging 
	with (e.g. "Local Area Connection"). See the Wiki at 
	http://wiki.colinux.org/ the page Network for more information/help.

4. Choose whether to download a root file system from the Cooperative Linux 
   sourceforge page. The installer will try to download directly in 
   the next step but if you experience any issues you can visit the
   Sourceforge page directly at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98788&package_id=108058

   NOTE ABOUT DISK SPACE: Each image extracts to over 1GB (or more), so make 
   sure you have enough space there before you start downloading/extracting 
   it. If you are manually downloading, put the extracted file in the 
   installation directory. To unzip .bz2 files, you can use Winzip or 7-Zip 
   (or the bzip utilities in Cygwin, etc). The image MUST be extracted from 
   the .bz2 archive before use!

5. Edit the config file to point to whatever root file system you 
   downloaded. 
   
6. The installation directory should include vmlinux, default.conf, the 
   supplied linux.sys driver and executables, and probably the root 
   filesystem image. Be sure to review the config file for any additional 
   configuration that may be needed.

7. Run coLinux. The current directory should be the installation directory, 
   if not, then you man need to change paths (especially for vmlinux)
   in the XML config file..

	a. Running as an service.  
		colinux-daemon.exe @default.conf --install-service "Cooperative Linux"
	   Also, to remove the service:
		colinux-daemon.exe --remove-service "Cooperative Linux".
	   Then go to the Service Manager and start the "Cooperative Linux"
	   service,
	   OR
		net start "Cooperative Linux"
	   Last, got to the installation directory and double-click on
		colinux-console-fltk.exe OR
		colinux-console-nt.exe
	b. As an regular application.
		colinux-daemon.exe @default.conf
	   See colinux-daemon --help for details about possible 
	   command-line arguments.
   
   The console window opens and you would see a Linux machine booting in 
   that window.


Post Installation
-----------------

You may wish to set up some post installation parameters, including increasing
the amount of memory allocated to Cooperative Linux, or adding a swap 
partition. See the Wiki at http://wiki.colinux.org/ for 
additional help on these tasks.


Command Line Parameters
------------------------

The following command line paramaters may be useful in operating Cooperative 
Linux.

    @filename

	Allows you to choose a specific configuration file to 
	use, can have multilple @filename on the command-line,
	last on the command-line take precedence and overrides
	prior.

    -k

	suppresses Kernel messages (good for debugging other daemons)

    -t consoletype

	Allows you to specify either the FLTK (default) or NT (-t nt) 
	console to use on startup. 

    -d
    
	Don't launch and attach a coLinux console on startup.  This is
	default for running as service.

    -v level

	Prints messages about booting process.  Level 1 is informative,
	level 2 performs more checks, level 3 prints details on errors,
	10 is for debugging.  Default is 0.

    --install-service servicename

	Allows you to install Cooperative Linux as a service. Also 
	use the -c parameter to specify your configuration file when 
	doing this. <servicename> is whatever you want it to be called.

    --remove-service servicename

	Allows you to remove the Cooperative Linux service. 

    --install-driver

	This command to install the driver portion of Cooperative 
	Linux. BIG NOTE: This already happens during the installation 
	of coLinux, on most cases you don't need to run it at all.
	
    --remove-driver

	This command will remove the driver portion of Cooperative
	Linux. BIG NOTE: This already happens during the uninstall
	of coLinux, on most cases you don't need to run it at all.

    --status-driver

	Show status about the installed/running driver.

OR

    If the first command-line argument on the command line is 
kernel= you will be able to give all the configuration on the 
command-line, in this "mode" the command-line arguments are:

    kernel=<path to vmlinux file>

	This specifies the path to the vmlinux file, typically
	kernel=vmlinux works.

    initrd=<path to initrd file>

	This specifies the path to the initrd file, typecally
	initrd=initrd.gz

    mem=<mem size>

	This specifies the memory size, assumes MB is the the
	unit type, so 64 is same as 64MB. Default if you leave
	this parameter out is 1/4 of your RAM if your RAM is >= 
	128, otherwise it's 16.  Default value is generally ok.

    cobdX=<path to image file>

	Use any number of these to specify the block device's
	image files

    alias=<path to image file> | :cobdX

	Use any number of these to specify an alias (hda1, etc)
	for an block device's image file.  <path to image file>
	can be to an partition using standard 
	\Device\HarddiskX\PartitionY format.

    cofsX=<path to windows directory>

	Use any number of these to specify a Cooperative 
	Host filesystem device (mount Host directory to coLinux
	local mount point). There are some limitations in it's
	use currently (namely non-ASCII files).

    ethX=tuntap | pcap-bridge | slirp,<options>

	Use any number X of these to specify network interfaces.
	The first argument select the interface type on host side,
	follow by any more options.

    ethX=tuntap,<network connection name>,<MAC>

	Use any number X of these to specify network interfaces,
	<network connection name> and <MAC> are optional.
	Network connection name is the name of TAP adapter,
	installed on your host system, mostly named
	"Local Connection 1".  Without name coLinux use the first
	adapter.  Let the name empty, if you have only one
	TAP driver installed.

    ethX=pcap-bridge,<network connection name>,<MAC>,<promisc>

	Use any number X of these to specify network interfaces,
	Networkname must be a name of your real ethernet or
	wireless card.  It is typical "Local Connection".

	<MAC> and <promisc> are optional.

	Default is 'promisc', Promiscuous mode allow to receive packets
	that not directly adressed to that adapter (sniffing mode).  This
	works for Ethernet adapters.  Some cases (Wireless cards) works
	only with 'nopromisc'.

    ethX=slirp,<MAC>,<redirections>

	Use any number X of these to specify network interfaces,
	<MAC> and <redirections> are optional.

	<redirections> take the form tcp|upd:hostport:linuxport[:count],
	multiple redirections are seperated by /, ie tcp:2222:22/tcp:8080:80
	<Redirections> must begin with protocol ("tcp" or "udp") then an
	":" seperator, the port on Windows host, followed by ":" seperator,
	and the port for the coLinux guest.  Optional third ":" seperator
	counts for port array.  More redirections have the same form and
	are seperated by "/".

    ttysX=<serial device name>,<mode parameters>

	Use any number X of these to specify serial interface (ttys0),
	and host specific device name (COM1).  <mode parameter>
	sets baudrate, data format and line disciplin., ie
	"BAUD=115200 PARITY=n DATA=8 STOP=1 dtr=on rts=on"
	Refer host system help (MODE -?) for more options.

    execX=<executable program>,<parameters>

	Use any number X of these to specify order of launching a
	program and terminamte at stopping linux. Use Quotation
	marks, if more as one parameter.

    root=<root device>

	This is the device (as coLinux gues sees it) to the root
	device.

    ANY additional parameters are passed to the coLinux kernel as is 
    (unmodified).  For sample "init 5" runs linux on specific runlevel.

    Read the file "colinux-daemon.txt" in your colinux installation
    directore for samples, and see the example.conf.


Common Problems
---------------

    "Unable to mount root fs"
	Generally this means that the root filesystem image is 
	missing, was specified incorrectly, or not uncompressed.

	Check the device name and index (cobd0, hda1).
	Verify, that the filename behind (cobd0=...) exist and is
	readable from current working directory, try it with a
	simple "DIR ..." on command prompt.

  Additional problems not know at time of release are typically 
documented on the Wiki (http://wiki.colinux.org/), look 
there for known problems.  If your problem isn't listed, report on the
