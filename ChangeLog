Sat May  8 12:36:42 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/driver.c (co_win32_manager_is_installed): 
	Let the user know if there's not enough privileges to access the driver.

Sat May  8 10:44:46 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/install/colinux.nsi: 
	Renamed ProductName from coLinux to "Cooperative Linux".

Sat May  8 10:40:58 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/configurator/configurator.py: 
	This is a start of a cross-platfrom configuration util.

Sat May  8 10:39:15 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/driver.c (co_winnt_load_driver_lowlevel_by_name): 
	The linux.sys file is installed regardless of the current running 
	directory of the colinux-daemon. This should address some driver
	installation problems from scripts the people were getting.

	I've also concentrated the driver installation code into the 
	daemon's code.

Fri May  7 22:16:04 2004  George Boutwell <gboutwel@praize.com>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/driver.c: 
	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/service.c: 
	Support for Event Logging the coLinux terminal prints if running
	as a service.

	Also fixed running the service after a reboot (the driver wasn't
	initialized).

Mon Apr 26 08:44:25 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/service.c (service_main): 
	Under the NetworkService privileges coLinux can't do its
	checks in co_winnt_daemon_main_with_driver(). Changing this
	to co_winnt_daemon_main() allows the service on Windows XP
	to work using the NetworkService permissions.

Sun Apr 25 07:44:10 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/cmdline.c (co_winnt_daemon_parse_args): 
	Fixed arugment parsing.

Sat Apr 24 22:40:41 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/console/console.cpp (global_resize_constraint): 
	Auto fit console size on startup.

Sat Apr 24 22:40:16 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/console/widget.cpp (console_widget_t): 
	increased font size.

Sat Apr 24 22:10:53 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/manager.c (coui_check_driver): 
	Make sure that the driver is started after we verified that it's installed.
	by default on boot Windows won't automatically start it.

Sat Apr 24 19:57:24 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/driver.c (co_winnt_daemon_main_with_driver): 
	When trying to restart coLinux, detect and remove old/buggy versions of the
	driver.

Sat Apr 24 19:55:52 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/manager.c (co_manager_status): 
	Fail the status request if the API version of the driver doesn't match 
	the API version of the daemon.

Sat Apr 24 09:56:35 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/conet-daemon/tap-win32.c (get_device_guid): 
	Add the ability to match against a preferred device name, so that
	specifing name= in the XML would actually mean something.

Sat Apr 24 09:17:17 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/daemon.c (co_daemon_launch_net_daemons): 
	Fix the daemon to pass the '-c' parameter to the network daemons 
	so that these daemons would know the instance ID of the coLinux 
	daemon.

Sat Apr 24 09:16:41 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/conet-daemon/main.c (handle_paramters): 
	Ditto.

Sat Apr 24 09:16:00 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/conet-bridged-daemon/main.c (handle_paramters): 
	Some fixes to make the network daemon be aware about 
	the coLinux instance id it needs to connect to.

Sat Apr 24 08:50:03 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/pipe.c (pipe_server_alloc_id): 
	Support for running more than one coLinux instance. This function 
	allocates coLinux instance IDs according to the existance of the 
	named pipes. It's not proof for race condition, but that's what
	there is at the moment.

Sat Apr 24 08:27:26 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/console/console.cpp (attach): 
	Ditto.

Sat Apr 24 08:19:07 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/user/console/console.cpp (attach): 
	Small fix to make the console connect to the right coLinux instance.

Sat Apr 24 07:58:16 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/kernel/block.c (co_os_file_block_detect_size_harddisk): 
	For detecting partition or disk size, use IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO first
	instead of trying to do a binary search.

Sat Apr 24 07:29:12 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/kernel/interface.c (co_manager_dispatch): 
	For some weird reason it wasn't generating the right assembly
	code, probably due to GCC optimizations.

Fri Apr 23 19:12:47 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* src/colinux/os/winnt/user/daemon/main.c (co_winnt_daemon_main): 
	Moved the call to co_winnt_affinity_workaround() up, to be before
	co_daemon_create(). Perhaps that would fix Richard's lockups.

Fri Apr 23 19:10:47 2004  Dan Aloni  <da-x@colinux.org>

	* Started to keep a source level ChangeLog. The old ChangeLog
	is now the NEWS file.
