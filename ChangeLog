* Version 0.6.1 
  * Linux port (for systems running kernel 2.6.x)
  * Added the ability to send Ctrl-Alt-Del.
  * Windows: 
    * Sizes of raw partition devices are now detected properly. This 
      means that the resierfs problems should be over, plus cat /dev/cobd* 
      would work for you.
    * Suspension of the host machine won't cause colinux-daemon problems like 
      memory leaks.
    * NSIS installer: Install cygwin1.dll only if it is not already in
      the user's search path. This will help to avoid multiply cygwin1.dll
      versions on the system (NEBOR Regis)
    * The daemon can install itself as a service (Jaroslaw Kowalski). 
      Stopping the service sends Ctrl-Alt-Del so that the Linux machine
      shuts down cleanly.
    * coLinux now builds using MingW32 and no longer depends on cygwin1.dll.
    * Added scripts for building the MingW32 cross compiler on Linux,
      plus scripts that download, compile, and install the libraries
      coLinux depends on.
  * Consoles: 
    * Fixed a bug in the clear operation: let it clear with the right video 
      erase character so that ncurses apps would appear properly.
    * Fixed virtual console switching (alt-f1, alt-f2, etc.) so it will
      save/redraw the screen like it should.
    * FLTK: The cursor is visible again.
	
* Version 0.6.0 AKA "Getting even"
  * Ballard, Jonathan H.:  
    * fixed implicit declarations
    * added co_os_realloc()
    * fixed overflow with the XML memory config
    * reimplemented os/winnt/user/daemon.c.
      A threaded implementation with with message queue,
      wait state, and error recovery.
    * merged the NT-native console. 
    * console updates and improvements (cocon, console-nt)
    * update FLTK/console clearscreen (20040305)
    * enabled console-nt exit (20040305)
  * Added more checks to the XML parsing.
  * Made the context switch code more sensitive about the processor's 
    capabilities, running coLinux on old AMD processors will hopefully not 
    cause a reboot anymore.
  * Linux patch upgraded to 2.4.25.
  * Hopefully fixed the %fs/%gs issue for good.
  * vmlinux can now be bigger while not causing the host to boot, this means
    that you can compile more stuff not as modules.
  * Reimplemented the method in which coLinux allocates memory in the host
    kernel. It now allocates memory from the unmapped free page pool, which  
    means you can use more than 256MB of RAM, unlike the previous method. 
    Note that the first coLinux boot may be a little slower since Windows is 
    freeing cache and swapping out stuff in order to provide accommodation for 
    Linux's memory. You can see it in action by looking at the Task Manager.
  * NSIS-based installer for the Windows binary distribution (based on 
    work by NEBOR Regis.
  * gettimeofday() now works. Things that broke because they depended on it
    should now work. I have to enable port I/O in order to for this to work,
    but I plan to disable it in the future. If you compile a new vmlinux
    Make sure that CONFIG_X86_TSC is enabled in your .config file.
  * New daemon switch -t: Type of console to launch. Default is fltk.
  * Added an NSIS installer script.

* Version 0.5.4 AKA "Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis" (%gs/%fs) release
  * Fixed an issue with i686-optimized pthread and the preservation of 
    %gs and %fs. The crashes that were caused by the i686 Gentoo image 
    should now disappear. 
    WINE would also work now ;)
  * cobd: Fixed accessing large block devices (1GB >). cobd0 was passing 
    wrong information to userspace.
  * conet: Statistics are now gathered (patch by Pat Erley)
  * Tuned the time conversion between Windows and Linux. The machine is 
    now initialized with the right date, not 4 days backwards.
  * Applied a configuration parsing fix (patch by Ballard Jonathan)
  * Some improvements of the switch code. We now preserve more registers,
    (MMX/SSE/SSE2/FP), and coLinux now has its own GDT. These changes 
    should assure stability on more systems and processors.
    This fix also appears to solve the problem where processes were stuck
    on nanosleep() calls.
  * conet-pcap: pcap-based daemon (contributed by Alejandro R. Sedeno). 
  * Network configuration is now handled in the coLinux configuration XML.
    For backward compatibility, add:
    <network index="0" name="TAP" type="tap"></network>
	
    If you want to use pcap (i.e, bridged Ethernet), add:
    <network index="0" name="XXXX" type="bridged"></network>
    (Where XXXX is a substring of your network adapter's name)
      
    Optional attributes: mac="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" - specifies the MAC
    address of the interface in the Linux side. Recommended on bridged
    networking setups, where more than one Windows machine will be 
    running coLinux on the same subnet.

    I also prepared the ground for supporting more than one network device
    (i.e, eth1, eth2, etc.), but it is not yet completed.
  * linux: avoid more I/O in time.c.

* Version 0.5.3 AKA "Valentine release"
  * Virtual CMOS system time is now passed to Linux, you no longer
    need to update the time using ntp on boot. Note that the virtual CMOS
    time is GMT, so the coLinux machine needs to set its own timezone.
  * cobd's devfs support was added to the Linux patch. Gentoo would work 
    now (based on a patch from Pat Erley). 
    A Gentoo root filesystem was created and released by Pat Erley.
  * Fixed an unwanted termination that was discovered when devfs was compiled
    in to the kernel.
  * Fixed an issue with mxml and the passage of boot parameters.
  * colinux-console: Fixed the CPU utilization issue.
  * colinux-console: Escape doesn't close the window now.
  * coLinux RAM is configurable, using a memory element in the XML under
    <colinux>, like: <memory size="64"></memory>. Minimum is 8MB, maximum 
    is 192MB. 
    WARNING: high values might destabilize Windows, because the memory is
    allocated from the non-cached pool which has a maximum of 256MB 
    system-wide, meaning there's less left for Windows drivers and 
    subsystems.
  * bin/cobuild.sh: Thomas Fritzsche contributed this script which
    automates the creation of a cross compilation cygwin environment 
    on Linux.
	
* Version 0.5.3-pre2
  * Fixed the reported (and unreported) network bugs. 
  * Worked out some scheduling issue.

* Version 0.5.3-pre1 AKA "flamed chicken"
  * Fixed a BSOD bug (thanks Richard Goodwin for the memory dump stacks)
  * No longer depending on the Microsoft DDK for the build (review doc/building),
    (thanks Nir Perry for the encourgement)
  * The daemon launches the console by default when it is launched (can be turned
    off with '-d', see '-h').
  * The daemon is killable just like a normal Windows process. Doing so stops the
    Linux machines cleanly (from Windows' standpoint), so feel free to close the
    window, end the task, CTRL-C, etc.
  * It no longer depends on the Microsoft DDK for the build.
  * An almost complete rewrite - we now use message passing instead of hardwired 
    ioctls(). Only the daemon communicates with the driver. The console and the
    network daemon communicate with the daemon using a named pipe.
  * Fixed the block device bug that fsck triggered (thanks Daniel Glockner)
  * Hopefully addressed the network corruption issue (thanks Daniel Glockner again)
  * Boot parameters are now passed to the kernel. Make sure you update your 
    XMLs with 'root=/dev/cobd0' if you still want to boot from the first 
    block device. 
  * The conet daemon is a separate process (shouldn't affect you).
	
* Version 0.5.2
  * Added some missing files to the build tree
  * doc/cygwin-cross-build - How to build a cygwin cross compilation tools
    on Linux.
  * Made the daemon more proofed to mistakes. It's logic about loading/
    unloading the driver is much more sane now.
  * Added a cursor support to the console.
